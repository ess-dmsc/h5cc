### What is this repository for? ###

This is a better HDF5 library. It actually follows modern C++ idioms. It doesn't hurt the eyes.

### How do I get set up? ###

Copy it to your project and use it. The included test executable will provide you some examples of how to use it.

You can also compile and run tests.
Go to some build directory, a different directory, not this directory. Run the following:
cmake ./sourcepath
make

### Contribution guidelines ###

Please help improve it. If you have any comments or you think it should cover a broader set of use cases, please let us know.
