# H5CC - a better HDF5 library #

### What is it for? ###

This is a better C++ library for HDF5. It follows modern C++ idioms. It doesn't hurt the eyes.

### How do I get set up? ###

Copy it to your project and use it. The included main.cpp has examples of how to use it.

You can also compile and run tests.
Go to some build directory, a different directory, not this directory. Run the following:
cmake ./sourcepath
make
